### How to set up the "tetris" command

To set up the "tetris" command as I did on the presentation gif, simply set the path to the tetris directory in the PATH environment variable. For those who don't know the trick, here's a short tutorial.

1. **First, search edit Environment variable in the Windows panel.**
